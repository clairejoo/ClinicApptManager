                <p>Dr Sam followed his dream of becoming a veterinary surgeon that began at age three. Since that time, he has developed a strong interest in oncology, internal medicine and animal behaviour. Now a Chartered Member of the Australian  Veterinary Association, Dr Sam continues his passion of providing the most up-to-date care to his patients and their two-legged family.
                <br> 
                Sam founded Southern Cross Vet in the heart of St Peters, bordering on Alexandria to the west, Marrickville to the east and Newtown to the north, to offer pet parents  a new level of service but with reasonable fees.

            <div class="card-body">
                <p>While a regular check–up is a wise idea for all of us, it’s absolutely vital for our pets. Animals obviously can’t always let us know when they are feeling under the weather – though they may exhibit some signs which owners should look out for which may indicate something is wrong, such as being off their food, moving abnormally, panting, vocalising, vomiting, being quiet or lethargic etc (talk to your vet for advice).

            <div class="card-body">
                <p>A regular visit to your local vet is the perfect opportunity to make sure your dog's vaccinations are up-to-date. Annual vaccinations should include distemper, leptospirosis, and parvovirus.
                <br>
                <br>
                Also, ask your vet for current recommendations about vaccines against bordetella ('kennel cough'), which may be important if you plan to travel with your dog or put him in a boarding kennel.

                <p>Your vet will also have a good look at your dog’s teeth to determine whether or not dental cleaning is required and, if so, when. 
                <br>
                <br>
                This is also a good time to evaluate your at-home dental care program with your vet.

                <p>Another subject you should discuss with your vet is the control of fleas, worms and ticks. Remember that fleas, or at least their larvae, can live year-round in your home and garden. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Vets can also provide help in identifying parasitic worms and advising on the best course of action to eliminate them.
